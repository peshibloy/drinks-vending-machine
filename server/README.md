Frontend/ Full Stack developer technical assignment
Intro
“Finite state machines are a great conceptual model for many concerns facing
developers – from conditional UI, connectivity monitoring & management to
initialization and more. State machines can simplify tangled paths of asynchronous
code, they're easy to test, and they inherently lend themselves to helping you avoid
unexpected edge-case-state pitfalls.” (http://machina-js.org/)

Your assignment is to
● Implement your own version of FSM (Finite State Machine) as a JavaScript
library for React.js applications.
● Write a simple React.js use case application for demonstrating the library
usage.
Notes

1. You don’t have to create two projects for the assignment, a dedicated folder
for the library is just fine, but it should be plugged out very easily.
2. The use case application can be written as a pure React.js or as a React-Redux
application.
3. The use case application must have a server-side integration (with any of the
free mock servers out there).
If you want to implement your own Node.js small server-side application, we
don’t mind of course.
4. It’s up to you to decide which version of JavaScript to use (ES5, ES6, ES7, even
TypeScript if you’d like).
5. The assignment must have a GitHub repository.

Bonus/Extra points will be given for
1. Writing tests.
2. Using Typescript
3. Writing client-side mock server responses for testing the use case application
offline.
4. A working demo deployed as a GitHub page for the assignment repository.

Other things to keep in mind
● We really love creativity and good-looking web pages.
● We love a self-explained and organized codebase.
● We want to see how good you are so feel free to add anything you think may
support it.
